7)   Troubleshooting:

Installation Issues

Problem:	The CD is in the CD-ROM drive, but the computer is not 
		recognizing it. 
Answers: 	The CD may be dirty or scratched.
Solutions: 	Make sure that the data side of the CD (shiny side) is not 
		dirty or scratched. If it is dirty, take a lint free 
		non-abrasive cloth and wipe gently to clean it (always wipe 
		from the inside of the CD to the outside edges).  If the 
		data side of the CD appears to be scratched, return the 
		game to the store that you bought it from, and exchange it 
		for a new copy. If you are unable to exchange the game at 
		the store that you bought it from, please call Customer 
		Support for information on our exchange policy.

To free up Resources:
 - Close all unnecessary programs running in the Background.  
 - Windows users can click on the 'Start' button, then the 
   "Run..." option.  At the command line type msconfig.  Click on the 
   startup tab and you can shut off many programs (except the system ones).
 - Check for malware, remove the crap!
 - Keep at least 1MB free on the hard drive/partition where the game is installed 
   or few hundreds more if swap file is placed there too.
 - Delete all files in your Windows \Temp folder, then empty the 
   Recycle Bin.
 - Run ScanDisk
 - Defrag your hard drive
 - Overclock (if you are not afraid and poweruser)

Launching the Game I

Problem:   	After launching the game from the Start menu or 
     	 	Desktop icon, you get a blank screen, a black box 
		that surrounds the mouse cursor, blurring or choppy 
		graphics, vertical lines on the screen, choppy sound, 
		or no sound.
Answer: 	There is probably a conflict between your video or 
		sound card and Microsoft's DirectX.
Solution: 	(see below)

For Windows users: 
 - Press the 'Start' button on the Windows 95/98-task bar and select 
   'Run...'. 
 - Type "dxdiag" then click on the 'OK' button. This will run the 
   DirectX Diagnostics Tool.
 - Make sure all your files are DirectX compatible. Select the 
   'DirectX Files' tab make sure there are no exclamation points 
   next to the file names.  If you find exclamation points under 
   this tab you will need to reinstall DirectX.
 - Make sure all of your drivers are DirectX compatible.  Select the 
   'DirectX Drivers' tab and make sure there are no exclamation 
   points next to any of the file names.  If you find exclamation 
   points under this tab you will need to update your drivers  
   through their web site.

NOTE:  The DirectX Diagnostic tool may not recognize if your current 
       drivers are too old for the current version of DirectX or OpenGL
       that the game uses. A good rule of thumb is to update your sound
       and video drivers.  If you have an older video card, the
       manufacturer may have stopped producing new drivers for it
       altogether.  If the manufacturer has stopped supporting your
       cards drivers you will need to purchase and install cards that
       will support the new version of DirectX.



General Guidelines

If you are experiencing video trouble, difficulties launching the 
game, or getting kicked-back to the desktop, you may need to make 
some changes to the Display Settings.  All of our newer games are 
designed to run in 16/32 bit color.  It may be better if you are 
running your desktop color resolution similar to games.  

Most of our newer games are designed to run at a resolution of 
640x480 at least.  If your monitor is not capable of switching to this 
resolution, the game will fail to launch. You must not be lame them and
edit the configuration file.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8)   Goods on the web:

Video card manufacturers regularly update their software drivers to 
enhance performance and stability, and to improve compatibility with
DirectX/ OpenGL.  You can find links to online support for your card
on the box or somewhere. You can download video drivers from chipset
developers websites anyway.
